# Algolia Native Search Integration

The module adds Algolia to a Search Engine list at the Stores->Configuration->Catalog->Catalog->Search Engine.
This removed a dependency on a ElasticSearch/OpenSearch engine.

The module leverages Adobe Commerce search engine pattern.  

##  Work in progress module
In the current build a PLP show products from an Algolia Index but sorting or filtering need to be adjusted to settings in Algolia configuration.
